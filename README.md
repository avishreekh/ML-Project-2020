# ML-Project-2020

This project aims to develop Reinforcement Learning agents that solve the given modified CartPole Environments. A detailed description of the problem statement can be found in the `Details` folder. 

## Environments
The environments are modified versions of the classic CartPole-v1 environment. The details of the environments can be found in the `Details` folder.

## Technical specifications
The notebooks are written in Python3 and use the following major libraries/frameworks:
1. Deep Learning framework: Keras, PyTorch
2. Environment providing framework: OpenAI Gym
3. Data processing: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
